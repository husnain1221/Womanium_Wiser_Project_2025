In the current stage of quantum computers, called the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, environmental disturbances and small errors in quantum gates make it hard to perform accurate calculations. This project looks closely at how such noise affects quantum circuits. We use the PennyLane library to design and test several circuits, including a "Quantum Galton Board," which works as a simple way to picture a one-dimensional quantum walk. This setup helps us clearly and precisely study how accuracy changes when noise is present.

We designed three different types of circuits: the Quantum Galton Board, a Hadamard-based Quantum Walk, and an Amplitude Encoding circuit for an exponential distribution. Using different circuits allowed us to see how each one reacts to noise in its own way. To make the tests realistic, we added different kinds of noise after each gate, including depolarizing noise, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit flips, and phase flips. Adding noise after every gate gives a more accurate picture of how errors build up during actual quantum computations. We then ran each noisy circuit thousands of times using Monte Carlo simulations to get a large set of results and create probability distributions from them.

Next, we compared the results from the noisy circuits to the perfect (noise-free) ones using different measurements. Fidelity was used to check how close the noisy results were to the perfect results, where a score of 1.0 means identical. We also used Hellinger distance, Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence, and Total Variation distance to measure differences, where a lower score is better. We found that as the noise level increased, Fidelity went down, and all the other distance measures went up. Visually, this appeared as flatter peaks in the probability distributions, showing that noise was destroying the intended structure and making the results more random.

In short, this project provides a clear and practical way to study how noise affects quantum circuits. Using the Quantum Galton Board as an example, it shows how sensitive current quantum computers are to errors. This work can be used as a starting point for testing methods to reduce errors and for studying more complex types of noise in the future. It offers useful insights for building more reliable quantum systems and algorithms.
